								<h2 class="major">Lab 3</h2>
								<h3>Description:</h3>
								<p>In this lab we will learn how to solder! Soldering is a technique to connect two pieces of 
								   metal together by melting another metal/alloy (Solder) between them. Solder has a much lower 
								   melting point than the copper wires or components that we will connect with it. Soldering is a 
								   very useful electrical prototyping skill.
								</p>
								<h3>Materials Used:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Arduino (Elegoo) Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
									<li>USB Cable</li>
									<li>USB Adapter</li>
									<li>Breadboard Jumper Wire</li>
									<li>Resistors</li>

									<li>Wire Stripper</li>
									<li>Diagonal Pliers</li>
									<li>Safety Glasses</li>
								</ul>
								<h3 class="major">PART 1: SOLDERING SETUP AND SAFETY</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Assemble all of the tools in the photo below</li>
									<li>Set up the soldering station by turning the soldering iron ON using the switch</li>
									<li>The appropriate temperature for soldering is between 600 ℉ - 700 ℉ (325 ℃ - 375 ℃), 
										so ensure that the number on the screen that represents the current temperature of 
										the iron is within this range.
									</li>
									<li>Once the temperature is set, be very careful while handling the soldering iron. The tip 
										of the soldering iron is at the temperature displayed so always grab the soldering iron using the handle.</li>
									<li>Never keep the soldering iron outside its stand; don’t put it directly on the table or on some other surface – it will burn through the material</li>
									<li>Once the soldering iron is turned on, turn on the fume extractor fan. Solder contains harmful chemicals and metals (like lead), so it’s important to have some ventilation and filtration, which are provided by the fume extractor.</li>
									<li>Always remember to wash your hands with soap and water after soldering</li>
									<li>Do not eat or drink near the soldering station</li>
									<li>Molten solder has a tendency to splatter, so you should always wear safety glasses while soldering to protect your eyes</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Problems Faced and Conclusion:</h3>
								<p>There were no problems faced with this section of the lab everything went smoothly.</p>

								<h3 class="major">PART 2: SOLDERING WIRES TO PROTOBOARD</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>After turning the soldering iron on and getting it heated, we need to tin and clean the iron. Tinning is the process of melting and depositing solder over the tip of the soldering iron</li>
									<li>After tinning, we need to clean the excess solder from the tip by rubbing the iron in the brass wire pad.</li>
									<li>Once cleaned, the soldering iron is ready to be used.</li>
									<li>Make sure you do the tinning + cleaning treatment every few minutes – soldering with the iron can quickly make it rough and unusable, which can be fixed by tinning and cleaning.</li>
									<li>Take a small (4-inch) piece of stranded wire and strip off about 2 mm of one of the ends using a wire stripper</li>
									<li>Roll up all the strands together (to make them adhere to each other), and insert the metallic part through one of the corner holes on the protoboard</li>
									<li>Once inserted, apply some solder on the tip of the soldering iron, and bring it to the top of the exposed metallic part to solder the wire to that hole in the protoboard</li>
									<li>As you see the liquid solder transfer to the metallic wire, slowly remove the soldering iron away to let the solder cool down and solidify</li>
									<li>You should see a small blob of shiny solder on top of the wire that you put through the protoboard hole. You’ve just completed your first solder joint!</li>
									<li>Be careful with how much solder you put on the joint. The liquid solder should just about cover the exposed wire and nothing more than that.</li>
									<li>Now, you can go ahead and solder the other end of this wire to the protoboard as well! Pick a hole 3-4 holes away from the one you just soldered on, and follow the same procedure. </li>
									<li>After attaching both sides of the stranded wire to the prototyping board, you can do the same with two small pieces of solid-core wire (3-4 holes away from the stranded wire joints)</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Example of tinned soldering iron tip:</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="http://bodhinpeterson-smart.me/img/IMG_2432.jpeg" alt="placeholder" /></span>

								<h3>Example of wire solder joints:</h3>

								<h3>Six solder joints:</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="http://bodhinpeterson-smart.me/img/IMG_2519.jpeg" alt="placeholder" /></span>
								
								<h3>Wires on the other side</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="http://bodhinpeterson-smart.me/img/IMG_2522.jpeg" alt="placeholder" /></span>

								<p>Note: The red wire is stranded and the two white wires are solid core</p>
								
								<h3>Problems Faced and Conclusion:</h3>
								<p>There were no problems faced with this section of the lab everything went smoothly.I found it easier to solder the solid-core wire to the protoboard because it stayed put better. 
								</p>

								<h3 class="major">PART 3: BRIDGE OF SOLDER</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Repeat same steps as previously stated</li>
									<li>In order to create a bridge, we first need to apply solder on two adjacent holes in the protoboard, and after that, deposit more solder onto them while molding the solder to form a bridge between the two holes</li>
									<li>Keep doing this for a series of adjacent holes, and you will end up with a trace between two separate points on the board.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>3 Solder Bridges:</h3>

								<span class="image main"><img src="http://bodhinpeterson-smart.me/img/IMG_2483.jpeg" alt="placeholder" /></span>

								<p>Note: These three solder bridges are wired in series for the Extra Volt circut later</p>

								<h3>Wires on the other side of the solder bridges:</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="http://bodhinpeterson-smart.me/img/IMG_2484.jpeg" alt="placeholder" /></span>

								<h3>Problems Faced and Conclusion:</h3>
								<p>This part of the lab was a bit more tedious and getting the solder to form bridges was definitely tricky.</p>

								<h3 class="major">PART 4: SPLICING WIRES</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Take 4 small (2-inch) pieces of stranded wires and strip their ends by about 2 mm using the wire stripper</li>
									<li>Hold the individual pieces upright using helping hands, and apply solder to the exposed metal in the wires</li>
									<li>Position the two wires such that the two exposed ends with solder are barely touching each other</li>
									<li>Hold them steady while touching the point of contact with the soldering iron such that the solder melts on both wires and combines to form a bigger blob of solder</li>
									<li>Once you see that the solder blob mostly covers the junction of the two wires, move the solder away and hold the wires steady until the solder completely solidifies</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 class="major">Extra Volt</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Complete steps associated with creating solder bridges to create 3 solder bridges in series</li>
									<li>Incorperate the pin header, LED, and 220 ohm resistor into the circut as shown in Lab 2</li>
									<li>Plug in the the negative terminal of the pin header into the GND of the arduino controller and plug the positive terminal of the pin header into the pin 10 on the arduino.</li> 
									<li>Install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</li>
									<li>Navigate to File > Examples > 01. Basics > Blink and click to open the Blink example in a new window</li>
									<li>Declare a global variable equal to 10 outside of the setup() function and the loop() functional declarations: “int LED_PIN = 10;”</li>
									<li>Replace LED_BUILTIN everywhere with our variables name:“int LED_PIN = 10;”</li>
									<li>Upload this code to the board by clicking on the arrow button on the toolbar</li>
									<li>Wait for the "Done Uploading" message</li>
									<li>Watch the LED on the Arduino Board blink repeatedly</li>

								<h3>Description:</h3>
								<p>
									In this lab, we begin interacting with electrical circuits in a more advanced 
									fashion—using analog input! We will learn how to use our Arduino to take analog 
									measurements from components like a potentiometer and an analog joystick, which is 
									like a multi-dimensional potentiometer. We will use these inputs to control different 
									LED arrangements and  create a simple Whack-a-mole game that is then made more advanced 
									in the Extra Volt!

									<li>Joystick Module</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 class="major">PART 1: USING A POTENTIOMETER</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Our kit includes a rotary potentiometer with three pins, two of which are “fixed ends”, and the third is a “variable end”, which, when we rotate the knob of the potentiometer, changes the resistance on the two sides of the variable end.</li>
									<li>Connect the two fixed sides to power (5V) (pin 1) and ground (pin 3)</li>
									<li>Measure the voltage on the variable end by connecting it to Analog pin A0</li>
									<li>When the potentiometer is dialed in all the way to the left, the voltage between pin 1 and pin 2 would be 0 Ω, and the voltage at pin 2 would be 5V. As we rotate the knob, the resistance between pin 1 and pin 2 would increase up to 10kΩ</li>
									<li>Follow code directions listed below</li>

								<h3 class= major>Part 2: LIGHT ‘EM UP WITH A POTENTIOMETER</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>To begin, take 5 LEDs from your kit (with colors of your choice), arrange them linearly on the breadboard, and set them all up to be individually digitally controlled using the digital I/O pins as you did in Lab 2.</li>
									<li>Do not remove the potentiometer circuit from the breadboard, as we will be using that to control the LEDs</li>
									<li>Follow the code as listed below to create a sketch where no LEDs are turned on if the potentiometer is turned all the way to the left (when the value reads 0). As you slightly rotate the knob, one LED turns on. If you rotate it a little more, two LEDs turn on, and so on, until all the 5 LEDs are turned on when the potentiometer is dialed all the way to the other side</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 class= major>PART 3: JOYSTICK FOR ARDUINO</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>After learning about how to use a potentiometer, we can move on to working with an analog joystick!</li>
									<li>This joystick is simply two potentiometers and a push button combined into one neat package. </li>
									<li>You will notice that the module has 5 pins: GND, +5V, VRx, VRy, SW. The first two are the ground and power pins, while the third and the fourth are variable pins of the two potentiometers – one for movement along the x-direction (VRx) and the other for movement along the y-direction (VRy).</li>
									<li>This means that these two pins need to be connected to any of the analog pins on the Arduino (A0-A5)</li>
									<li>The last pin SW is for the push button, which goes HIGH when you press on the joystick, and LOW otherwise – it can be connected to a digital pin.</li>
									<li>You can remove the potentiometer breadboard but retain the 5 LEDs, as we will be using them in the next part.</li>

								<h3 class= major>PART 4: LIGHT ‘EM UP WITH A JOYSTICK</h3>

								<ul>
									<li>Rearrange the 5 LEDs on the breadboard into a ‘plus (+)’ layout as shown below.</li>
									<li>Be careful of where the LEDs are connected on the breadboard – the pins of two different LEDs should not be in the same row of the breadboard, else we will not be able to control them independently!</li>
									<li>After setting up the circuit, we want to program the Arduino to control which LEDs get turned on based on the input from the joystick. The sketch should perform the following behavior:</li>
									<li>When the joystick is moved up, the top LED turns on. Similarly, joystick to down → bottom LED on, joystick to left → left LED on, and joystick to right → right LED on.</li>
									<li>When the joystick is moved diagonally to top-right, both the top and the right LED turn on. Similarly, joystick to top-left → top and left LED on, joystick to bottom-right → bottom and right LED on, and joystick to bottom-left → bottom and left LED on.</li>
									<li>When the joystick is centered, only the center LED should be on.</li>
									<li>Follow the code listed below</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 class= major>PART 5: BASIC LED WHACK-A-MOLE</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In this part of the lab, we will use the joystick and the plus-arrangement of the LEDs to create a simple whack-a-mole game! The gameplay of this game should be as follows: </li>
									<li>Each round begins with a welcome/ready message on the serial monitor and two 500ms long blinks of the center LED. After the blinks, all LEDs are off, and the game waits for 1 second for the player to get ready. When the 1 second elapses, a timer starts running (Hint: use a start-time variable to track the time).</li>
									<li>The game randomly chooses one of the four corner LEDs (top, bottom, left, right) to turn on (Hint: use the random() function from Lab 2). The LED stays on until the player moves the joystick in its direction (e.g. moving the joystick up when the top LED is on/active).</li>
									<li>As soon as the joystick is moved in the direction of the active LED, it turns off, and the game randomly chooses another LED to turn on. The new LED can be the same as the previous LED. This occurs 20 times.</li>
									<li>After 20 LEDs have been activated and consequently “whacked” using the joystick, the round is over.  The timer is stopped and the total time taken by the player is displayed on the serial monitor.</li>
									<li>At the end of the round, the game waits for 3 seconds before going back to step (1) and restarting the round.</li>
								<ul>

						<!-- Lab 5 -->
								<article id="lab5">
									<h2 class="major">Lab 5</h2>

								<h3>Description:</h3>
								<p>
									This lab is about having the Arduino interact with the world using analog outputs! While we have been using LEDs to output from the Arduino in the past few labs (remember LED Reaction Game and Whack-A-MoLED?), we will now create some complex output from the Arduino in two contexts – visual and sound. In the first two parts of the lab, we will light up the RGB LED in different colors. In the latter two parts, we will create interesting sounds using a piezo buzzer. Finally, in the Extra Volt, you will get the chance to combine the two outputs to create your own audio-visualizer!
								</p>

								<h3>Materials Used:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Arduino (Elegoo) Uno R3 Controller Board</li>
									<li>USB Cable</li>
									<li>USB Adapter</li>
									<li>Breadboard Jumper Wire</li>
									<li>Resistors</li>
									<li>LEDs</li>
									<li>Joystick Module</li>
									<li>Passive Buzzer</li>
									<li>Multimeter</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 class= major>PART 1: WIRING UP THE RGB LED</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In the first part of the lab, we will connect the RGB LED from our kits to the Arduino</li>
									<li>In the RGB LED included in our kit, the longest leg is for ground, which is also the second pin from the flat side of the LED bulb</li>
									<li>Be super careful while connecting the four pins to the Arduino and double check before powering the circuit</li>
									<li>An important thing to note is that not all the digital pins on the Arduino support Pulse-Width Modulation, which is what we need to make the RGB LED turn on into different colors</li>
									<li>Only pins with numbers labeled with a ‘~’ next to them allow PWM – which include 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 on the Arduino Uno board</li>
									<li>Follow the code as listed below. You can change the R,G, and B values in the analogWrite() functions to create different colors</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 class= major>PART 2: DYNAMIC COLOR CHANGER WITH JOYSTICK</h3>

								<h3>Procedure:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In this part, we will use the analog joystick from our kits to change the colors produced on the RGB LED</li>
									<li>Connect the joystick to the Arduino as we did in the previous lab (feel free to refer to Lab 4 handout)</li>
									<li>Write an Arduino sketch that detects the x and y values of the joystick and maps them to two colors (out of R, G, B) of your choice in the RGB colors space</li>
									<li>For example, you could have the x-value determine the R brightness, while the y-value determine the B brightness. For the third color (in this case, G), use a random value.</li>
									<li>Follow the code listed below</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>Which resistor should be used?<h3>
								<p>A 220 ohm resistor needs to be used for the RGB light</p>

								<h3>Problems Faced and Conclusion:</h3>
								<p>At first the LED was a bit laggy but I was able to fix it by removing the delay</p>
						



								<h3 class= major>PART 3: MUSICAL NOTES WITH PASSIVE BUZZER</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In this lab, we will be using the passive buzzer to generate different sounds. Both the buzzers in the kit look very similar, so take care to pick the one with the exposed green PCB on the underside, and no white sticker on the top. </li>
									<li>Note that the buzzers have polarity—their positive pin can only be connected to a positive terminal; and their negative pin can only be connected to a negative terminal. If you plug them in reverse, you will irreversibly damage the component.</li>
									<li>Connect the passive buzzer to the Arduino such that the positive terminal (with the + icon) is wired to a digital pin and the negative terminal is connected to the ground</li>
									<li>The buzzer can be connected to any of the digital pins on the Arduino – not only the PWM ones labeled as ‘~’</li>
									<li>Follow the code listed below</li>
								</ul>
